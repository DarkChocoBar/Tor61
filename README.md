# Tor61
I'm working in the branch "DevelopTorRouter"

TorMain.java is what needs to be run.
I created a run script that runs TorMain.java. It's in the src directory

Left comments for things to do
Search for the string:
// THINGS TO DO:
to find places that need to be implemented

Just a warning, but TorRouter.java is a huge class.
There are many global variables in TorRouter that many of the inner classes depend on
ie. Routing Table, global variable to kill threads, ect.

The biggest thing we still need to do is the Tor Header packing/unpacking processing
